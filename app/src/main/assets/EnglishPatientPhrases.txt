I need to use the toilet
I would like some food
I would like some water
What is this?
My pain is better
My pain is worse
My pain is the same
My stomach hurts
I am dizzy
I do not feel good
I feel weak
I am having trouble breathing
I feel nauseous
I think I have a fever, could you take my temperature?
Can you check my vitals?
Can you charge my phone?
I need to make a phone call
Can you close my blinds?
Can you open my blinds?
I cannot sleep
I would like some medication to help me sleep
Can I have a pillow?
Can I have a blanket?
Can I move to the chair?
Can I raise my head?
Can I lower my head?
Can I change my position?
I feel uncomfortable
I would like to do that myself
I would like that later
May I see the nurse?
